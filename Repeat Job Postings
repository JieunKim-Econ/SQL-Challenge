-- Question: Report Job Postings
Given a table of job postings, write a query to retrieve the number of users that have posted each job only once 
and the number of users that have posted at least one job multiple times.

Each user has at least one job posting. Thus the sum of single_post and multiple_posts should equal the total number of distinct user_idâ€™s.

-- Example:

-- Input:
  [job_postings] table

 +-----------+------------+
   Column	      Type
 +-----------+------------+
 id	            INTEGER
 job_id	        INTEGER
 user_id	      INTEGER
 date_posted    DATETIME
+-----------+------------+
 
-- Output:
+-------------+------------+
   Column	         Type
+-------------+------------+
single_post	    INTEGER
multiple_posts	INTEGER

-- Solution
WITH summary AS (
    SELECT user_id,
    COUNT(job_id) AS total_job_posted ,
    COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS unique_job_posted
    FROM job_postings
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN total_job_posted = unique_job_posted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
    AS single_post,
    SUM(CASE WHEN total_job_posted != unique_job_posted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
    AS multiple_posts
FROM summary;
